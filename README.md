# Satzanalyzator


## Use Case

The Satzanalyzator is a grammar annotation tool. It allows students of German to identify the most important parts of speech in a sentence. It arose from the pedagogical insight that learning to read in German is best accomplished by identifying key parts of speech, namely a verb and the various nouns and pronouns that the verb coordinates, such as the subject, accusative object, dative object, etc.

How to use the application:
- Enter the text you want to annote, or use the example text.
- Click on the part of speech you want to identify.
- Select the word(s) in the text that correspond to that part of speech.
